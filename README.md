### 📌 Ride-Booking App (MERN + Microservices) – Work in Progress 🚀

#### **Overview**  
This is a ride-hailing application inspired by Uber, built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js)**. The project is designed to integrate **microservices architecture** for scalability and efficient system management.  

📢 **Status: Work in Progress**  
I am currently learning **backend development, API design, and microservices**, and I am implementing this project step by step.
